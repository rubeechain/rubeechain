## the **"Remote Utility Bonded Execution Environment Chain"**
###     _Next generation blockchain scaling and financing using Remote Utility Bonded Execution Environments_

* RUBEEchain (Remote Utility Bonded Execution Environment chain) components  are computational components with trustworthiness measured by earned reputation and guaranteed by RUBEEchain tokens. RUBEEchain is a next generation evolution of the Trusted Execution Environment concept adapted to support blockchain scaling and financing.

* RUBEEchain enables increases in blockchain scaling by providing a mechanism for ranking the trustworthiness of peer-to-peer network nodes, thereby supporting extreme sharding. High reputation RUBEEchain components also provide a distributed on-demand mechanism for the storage of secrets in blockchain smart contract applications.

* RUBEEchain tokens provide a financial mechanism for the renting of RUBEEchain computational slices, thereby dissolving the fee-based cloud hosting market into a fee-based peer-to-peer fog. A portion of the RUBEEchain renting fee is retained by the RUBEEchain component as a measure of its accumulated reputation. The owners of RUBEEchain components collect RUBEEchain tokens for the renting of their RUBEEchain computational resources and can collect the accumulated RUBEEchain reputation bond of a component by retiring the component or by selling it at its appreciated value.

* RUBEEchain components provide fine grained reputation accounting with separable ranking according to availability, integrity, and confidentiality. RUBEEchain token reputation bonds are forfeit to the renter of the RUBEEchain resource upon failure to meet requirements, thereby providing automated service level agreements. Smart contracts and other blockchain applications can select their RUBEEchain components based on reputation ranking and characteristics best suited to the application needs.
